### Events ###
ott.1.t:0 "The Sublime State"
ott.1.d:0 "Once the greatest empire in existence, spanning three continents and ruling over millions of people the Ottoman Empire had declined by the late 19th century, to the point of being known as the 'sick man of Europe'. An inability to industrialise, the nonexistence of an educated middle-class, and a chronic lack of funds meant that the Ottoman State had dropped back well behind the European powers by 1876, when Abdülhamid II took the throne.\n\nAt the time, the Ottoman army was still reeling from the shock of the Russo-Turkish war of 1877, the Ottoman treasury had just declared bankruptcy and several interest groups were scheming to obtain political control of the Empire. These weaknesses led the Empire to seek closer cooperation with European powers.\n\nPrussian military successes against France led the Empire to form military and economic ties with the Germans, culminating in the construction of the Berlin-Baghdad railway in 1888.\n\nDuring his reign Abdülhamid II launched massive education programs and made desperate diplomatic manoeuvres to keep his Empire intact; while at the same time he engaged in systematic repression of opposition groups in an effort to maintain his absolute rule.\n\nDespite these efforts, a revolt of the 'Young Turks' in 1908, the subsequent dethronement of Abdülhamid II in 1909, and a bloody coup in 1913 meant that in the days leading up to the Weltkrieg, the Ottoman Empire was ruled by a triumvirate of 'Three Pashas'; Enver, Talat and Cemal.\n\nIn 1914, as the Weltkrieg began in Europe, the Young Turk government signed a secret treaty with the Germans and soon after joined the war against the Entente powers..."
ott.1.a:0 "God save the Empire..."

ott.2.t:0 "Black Monday hits Ottoman Empire!"
ott.2.d:0 "Almost a month ago, the Berlin Stock Exchange plunged into bottomless depths, throwing the economy of the German Empire into an unprecedented crisis. Now the shock waves of the crash have reached the Ottoman Empire. German and Austrian-owned companies have closed down or laid-off their workers, the Ottoman lira is losing it's already-low value, and resource exports are shrinking. Our unstable economy is on the verge of collapse..."
ott.2.a:0 "Great Allah protect us!"

ott.3.t:0 "Initial Stabilisation"
ott.3.d:0 "With the first wave of the crisis slowly passing by, some less affected branches of the economy have bounced back from the bottom. Still, the overall state of our economy does not look optimistic..."

Since the reign of Sultan Bayezid II, who allowed the settlement of the Iberian Jews in his lands after their expulsion from Spain, they have been an integral part of the empire. However, since the rise of Zionism, laws have been passed to prevent the mass-settlement of foreign Jews in Palestine, while avoiding restriction on their pilgrimages. Recently we have been approached by members of the international Jewish lobby, asking for less constricting laws."

Since their settlement in Jerusalem and the environs, it has become clear that Hebrew is rapidly becoming the second, and some might even argue first language of Palestine. The ideals of Zionism have also entered our lands, and several Judaic factions have already requested increasing amounts of autonomy, even verging on demands for independence."

ott.7.b:0 "Grant them local autonomy."

ott.8.t:0 "The Great Arab Revolt!"

ott.13.t:0 "Status Quo Antebellum"
ott.13.d:0 "After narrowly escaping defeat and destruction in the Weltkrieg, the Ottomans found that they had lost much for little gain. Suffering through 12 years of war, disease and poverty, the Ottoman Empire had gained nothing to show for it.\n\nFollowing the gloomy conclusion of the disastrous war, Enver, Talat and Cemal Pashas attempted to reinforce their authority, but the Committee of Union and Progress government had lost all credibility by then. Added to this was the immense pressure from various groups to prosecute the Young Turks responsible for dragging the Empire into war. This quickly led to the downfall of the triumvirate, who escaped abroad.\n\nWith German support the Ottoman Sultan had regained a semblance of authority, albeit weak. Unfortunately the Germans had an interest in maintaining the status quo and so consistently backed the monarchy in any clashes with opposition groups, while at the same time letting Sultan Mehmed VI know that non-compliance on his part would lead to a withdrawal of their support.\n\nIn 1936 then the Empire is staggering and slipping. More and more groups demanding reforms are appearing, to be joined by various nationalist groups intent on achieving independence. Economically too it is reliant on German support, especially the oil trade from the Middle East. In other words the Ottoman Empire is now regarded as the 'terminally ill man of Europe'."

March 21st is an important date for these separatists, as it marks the day of traditional spring festivities and the Persian New Year. During this year's Nawruz celebrations, a seemingly small incident in Diyarbakır quickly got out of hand and turned into large-scale revolt. Protests and riots are erupting across our Kurdish provinces, and while we have reason to suspect the Syndicalists are behind it all, many Kurdish landowners and tribes have declared their support for the movement as well."
ott.15.a:0 "This does not look good..."

ott.16.t:0 "Kurdish Uprising"
ott.16.d:0 "As the Ottoman Gendarmerie failed to defuse the situation, Kurdish riots grew day by day.

Most of the debt had been owed to French and British government as well as private institutions and had, as a consequence, been unilaterally defaulted by the Ottoman government when revolution swept away the regimes in London and Paris.

Various left-wing groups were spotted among the rioters as protesters clashed with the security forces and started damaging public buildings. As the initially civil protests quickly deteriorated into vandalism and anarchy, they began to lose their support among the conservative sections of the Ottoman public.

ott.94.d:0 "Following several weeks of anarchy and rioting on the streets of Kostantiniyye, the protests eventually died down. While damage to public buildings and services were minimal, damage to the credibility of the protesters was immense. The conservative Ottoman public, always wary of chaos and instability, had chosen to side with the Sultan.

It forms an indivisible whole, from which no portion can be detached under any pretext whatever.\nArticle 2. Kostantiniyye is the capital of the Ottoman Empire.\nArticle 3.

ott.100.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Houses of Parliament"
ott.100.d:0 "In the Constitution of 1876, the Houses of Parliament were established comprising of a Lower House (Meclis-i Mebusan) and an Upper House (Meclis-i Âyan). The Grand Vizier, handpicked by the Sultan, presided over the Houses of Parliament. The liberal members of the Committee are arguing that the Grand Vizier (and by extension, rest of the government) should be decided by votes, and not by an Imperial Decision of the Monarch."
ott.100.a:0 "The Sultan will appoint the Grand Vizier."
ott.100.b:0 "The Government shall be formed by the Parliament."

ott.101.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Parliamentary Schedule"
ott.101.d:0 "In the old constitution, Sultan had the rights to open, prorogue, and dissolve the parliament. As there had been a notorious occasion when Sultan Abdülhamid II abused his powers to prorogue the Parliament and not call another session for 30 years, many liberal members of the Sublime Committee are wary of allowing such powers again. What shall be the decision?"
ott.101.a:0 "The Sultan opens and dissolves the parliament."
ott.101.b:0 "Parliament schedule is set by the Constitution."

ott.102.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Veto Rights"
ott.102.d:0 "Another contentious issue was the veto rights of the Sultan. Monarchist and conservative members of the Committee insisted that Sultan, whom represents the collective will of the Ottoman Public, should have unchallenged veto powers, while liberal MP's pushed for the supremacy of the Parliament."
ott.102.a:0 "The Sultan gets the last word."
ott.102.b:0 "A veto can be overturned by two-thirds majority."

ott.103.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Right to Petition"
ott.103.d:0 "Article 63 of the Constitution states that 'One or more persons of Ottoman nationality have the right of presenting petitions in the proper quarter relating to the breaking of law and regulation, and may likewise present in protest signed petitions to the General Ottoman Assembly, complaining of the conduct of state servants and functionaries.' \n\nWhile this article by itself seems sufficiently just, several members of the Sublime Committee suggested that minorities should be explicitly allowed to present petitions in local languages, as not stating this would allow a loophole where local governments could arbitrarily decide not to process petitions written in languages other than Turkish."
ott.103.a:0 "Allow petitions written in local languages."
ott.103.b:0 "If they want to complain, they should learn Turkish."

ott.104.t:0 "Ottoman Constitution - Rights of Trade Unions"
ott.104.d:0 "The issue of the rights of the trade unions and syndicates was a dreaded one, as both liberals and conservatives were wary of syndicalist factions gaining excessive powers. Three articles were composed after careful deliberation, aiming to give sufficient rights to the workers and limit syndicalist influence."
ott.104.a:0 "Allow all trade unions, strikes and lockouts."
ott.104.b:0 "Such godless syndicalism has no place in the Ottoman Empire!"

ott.105.a:0 "Long live the Sultan!"

ott.106.t:0 "Independence of the Judiciary"
ott.106.d:0 "Our chief legal experts argue that in the decision-making process, judges should have freedom to decide cases impartially, in accordance with their interpretation of the law and the facts; that they should be able to act without any restriction or improper influence. They claim that one of the most important standards underpinning the autonomy of the judiciary is immovability, that is, for ordinary judges to be appointed permanently until retirement. Shall we give such guarantees of independence to our judges?"
ott.106.a:0 "We must ensure the independence of our Judiciary."
ott.106.b:0 "They shall have parliamentary oversight."
ott.106.c:0 "I am the law."

ott.107.t:0 "Centralisation or Decentralisation?"
ott.107.d:0 "While the Article 108 of the Ottoman Constitution declares that the vilayets shall be governed by the principle of 'decentralisation', this de jure principle has never transformed into action. Now that our sweeping administrative reforms are underway, the proponents of the doctrine of 'Adem-i Merkeziyet' are again asserting that subordinating local decision-making to the central bureaucracy results in tremendous inefficiency and pointless delays. With our distant subjects chafing under the direct rule of Kostantiniyye, it would be wise to give more power to local governments over our centrally-appointed governors. Shall we grant greater powers and freedoms to the administrative councils of our Vilayets?"
ott.107.a:0 "More power to the local governments!"
ott.107.b:0 "Frankly, I don't see the need for reform."

ott.108.t:0 "Indifference to New Laws"
ott.108.d:0 "Even though we made many changes to administrative law during the course of legal reforms, we are receiving numerous reports of regulators and bureaucrats completely disregarding the new laws, especially the ones concerning anti-corruption measures."
ott.108.a:0 "What is this insolence?!"

ott.109.t:0 "Interference in Courts!"
ott.109.d:0 "In former days, local administrators and military governors could freely interfere with legal proceedings, and sometimes even upturn court decisions. Such interference, coupled with corruption, quickly gave rise to injustice and public discontent. And although with our judicial reforms we aimed to prevent any such events from occurring again in the future, we are still receiving petitions from aggrieved peasants detailing high-level interference in courts of law."
ott.109.a:0 "Who dares interrupt justice?"

ott.110.t:0 "Ineffective Administration"
ott.110.d:0 "It has been several months since we formally adopted the metric system and the Standard Ottoman script, but we are still receiving troubling reports of incompetent bureaucrats being completely unable to use the new standards of measurement, while dozens of nearly-illiterate government officials have been discovered after they have proved incapable of deciphering the new form of official writing. It appears that the full implementation of these reforms will take more time than anticipated."
ott.110.a:0 "Who hired all these useless officials?!"

ott.111.t:0 "Corrupt Bureaucracy"
ott.111.d:0 "The notoriously widespread corruption in the Ottoman bureaucracy is a long-established phenomenon. Over the centuries, low wages and even lower moral standards of Ottoman government officials resulted in the gradual acceptance and normalisation of bribery as a means of income. Legitimised under terms such as 'hediye' and 'caize', corruption became so commonplace that several Ottoman sultans were recorded to have accepted bribes. Many efforts to curtail corruption were made over the centuries, none of them successful. Unfortunately, it seems that our coordinated efforts to end bribery are about to meet the same fate. The reforms we instituted, which include new laws and severe penalties, are being casually disregarded by the old-headed bureaucrats, almost all of whom are feeling quite secure in their entrenched positions in the government. Several reports we have received indicate that any action taken against these corrupt officials are quickly covered-up by complicit superiors and high officials. It appears that eliminating corruption will not be an easy task."
ott.111.a:0 "Reinstitute the anti-bribery oath!"

ott.112.t:0 "Report on Corruption"
ott.112.d:0 "Today we received a very troubling report concerning the unlawful use of crown lands in Yalova. According to this report, several bureaucrats from the Treasury are colluding with local administrators in Yalova in order to embezzle from Mukataa farmland revenues. Yet another group in the same region is illegally renting out Royal Property belonging to the nieces of the Sultan. The report further claims that both groups are being protected through shady bookkeeping in the Ministry of Interior. According to our royal accountants, this shameless act of robbery is costing us up to millions of Reichsmarks every year! Should we investigate these claims?"
ott.112.a:0 "I want action on this!"

ott.113.t:0 "Police Chief Murdered!"
ott.113.d1:0 "Terrible news! Muharrem Arif Paşa, head of Emniyet-i Umumiye, was murdered outside his house this morning! On Sultan's orders, Muharrem Arif Paşa was leading the 'Royal Investigation into Corruption' concerning the embezzlement of Yalova crown land revenues. Several witnesses reported seeing two assassins firing at Muharrem Paşa from an unmarked white car before driving away. There is no doubt that the assassination is linked to the Yalova case, and the search for the white car is already underway."

ott.115.d:0 "The Yalova arrests attracted great attention, and were protested by several prominent politicians, Mehmed Cavid Bey of Teceddüt Party foremost among them. From the preliminary reports, it appears that many of the corrupt officials had connections to the Teceddüt and Selamet-i Osmaniye Parties, and the Undersecretary of the Interior currently under arrest was a close relative of Mehmed Cavid Bey, who nominated him for the position in 1917 during his time as Minister of Finance. And even though the money trail does not reach Mehmed Cavid Bey, evidence conclusively shows that he worked to cover-up the scandal and protect the corrupt officials through his political connections. Should we take action against these politicians?"

According to an unconfirmed report, the putschists burst into the Royal Chambers of Sultan Abdülmecid II and tried to force his abdication. Unexpectedly, the old and stubborn Sultan pulled out his gold-engraved revolver with a shaky hand, and a terrible firefight ensued. Sultan Abdülmecid II and three of his personal guards were slain in the fighting. Undeterred, the putschists captured Ahmed Nihad Efendi and proclaimed him the new Sultan.

In full ceremonial uniform, armed with lance, carbine and cavalry sabers, the household cavalry charged downhill to the Dolmabahçe palace and crushed the paramilitary rebels positioned outside. Assaulting the palace itself, they chased the rebels through the building, and rescued [Root.GetLeader]. Osman Fuad was reportedly enraged to find the Sultan murdered and swore justice would be done.

Encountering no resistance at the Parliament, Osman Fuad positioned his infantry to defend the main road and marched on with his cavalry. The elite Ertuğrul Cavalry Regiment soon reached the Galata Bridge, held by rebel paramilitary units.

The Ottoman Empire had first started taking foreign debts in 1854 during the Crimean War, and after decades of indiscriminate spending, had eventually become unable to pay even the monthly interest.

ott.164.d:0 "Endless revolts in the Yemen Vilayet had forced the Ottoman Empire to negotiate the Treaty of Da'an (1911) with the Imam Yahya of Yemen. According to the treaty, the Zaydi Imam was given the power to appoint governors and judges in Shia-majority areas, as well as collect taxes from his followers, while remaining under Ottoman authority. The Ottomans still administered the Sunni areas and maintained a sizeable garrison force. Following the conclusion of the Weltkrieg, Yemen became relatively isolated from the rest of the empire. The Zaydi Imam had renewed his oath of allegiance to the Ottoman Sultan, but also extended his authority over our entire Vilayet. With our control over Arabia strengthened, how shall we proceed?"

ott.168.t:0 "A Gift to the Emir of Bukhara?"
ott.168.d:0 "Diplomatic relations between the Emirate of Bukhara and Ottoman Empire were first established in the early 1920's. In 1925, Mohammed Alim Khan of Bukhara visited Kostantiniyye to meet with Sultan Mehmed VI, and had a spectacular public fountain built in Eyüp, now known as 'Buhara Çeşmesi'. Cordial relations were maintained, but no further visits followed. Recently, as part of our diplomatic efforts to bring Turkic nations together, it was suggested that Sultan [Root.GetLeader] send a worthy gift to the Emir of Bukhara."
ott.168.a:0 "Send a custom-made Ottoman rifle!"

ott.169.t:0 "Ottoman Khan Sends Beautiful Gift!"
ott.169.d:0 "Today we received the ambassadors of [From.GetLeader], the Khan of the Ottomans, who brought with them a beautifully engraved Ottoman rifle for [Root.GetLeader]. Its master craftsmanship is evident from the solid construction and ornate exterior, fitted with intricate gold-engraved plates. The ambassadors said they wish to express the goodwill and friendship of the Ottoman Khan. How shall we respond to such a gift?"
ott.169.a:0 "Respond with a purebred Akhal-Teke!"
ott.169.b:0 "We don't need gifts from the filthy Oghuz!"

ott.170.t:0 "Emir of Bukhara Sends a Purebred Warhorse!"
ott.170.d:0 "Today we received a tall warhorse of glorious beauty from the Emir of Bukhara, in exchange for the custom rifle we had sent him. The ambassadors also brought a letter from [From.GetLeader], who wrote that he wished to see our blood relations be reinforced by mutual friendly relations maintained for all eternity. The shiny golden horse is named Kamarbay, and walks as if it flows through the air. Indeed, this is a gift worthy of a Sultan."
ott.170.a:0 "You have bested us in generosity, [From.GetLeader]"

ott.171.t:0 "Turkestan Bans Our Ambassadors!"
ott.171.d:0 "My Sultan, our ambassadors have been banned! Turkestan gave us no reason why they acted the way they did. We suspect the ambitions of [From.GetLeader] are behind this!"

ott.172.t:0 "Gendarmerie Seizes Weapons Shipments"
ott.172.d:0 "A large group of smugglers were stopped by the Ottoman Gendarmerie in the outskirts of Diyarbakır yesterday, who turned out to be transporting several thousand rifles and a large amount of explosives into the city. The weapons were of French origin, while interrogation of the smugglers revealed they had obtained the crates from syndicalists in Georgia. A large-scale investigation is currently underway."
ott.172.a:0 "What were they planning to do with all these rifles?"

ott.173.t:0 "Syndicalist Agents Caught In Mosul"
ott.173.d:0 "Our gendarmerie, with the aid of locals, has uncovered a network of syndicalist agents in Mosul who were allegedly arming and training militias to fight against our rule. In a series of raids 3 syndie agents were captured and important documents were discovered. It appears that Georgian and French Syndicalists are trying to organise an armed uprising in our Kurdish provinces."
ott.173.a:0 "Preposterous!"

ott.174.t:0 "Traitors Caught In Ağrı"
ott.174.d:0 "In course of the ongoing operations against Syndicalist interference in our Eastern provinces, a company-sized unit of our gendarmerie force was ambushed by Kurdish tribesmen near the Armenian border. Reinforcements from the army were quick to arrive on the scene, and the rebels were swiftly routed. While many of them managed to cross the border into Persia, our cavalry units managed to surround a small group of bandits who immediately surrendered. Among them were several Ottoman officers, including İhsan Nuri Bey. To everyone's surprise, a brief inquiry into the population records showed that these Ottoman-educated officers were not of Kurdish background, but instead had Armenian and Georgian ancestry. While it is not entirely clear why they were championing the cause of Kurdish separatism, it is evident that a wider conspiracy is at work..."
ott.174.a:0 "Why would such groups infiltrate our military?"

ott.175.t:0 "Druze Insurrection Crushed In Syria"
ott.175.d:0 "A large revolt of Druze tribesmen was recently crushed by our Desert Rangers. Hundreds of rebels have been killed, while the routed tribes returned to their villages and ceased their raids on our trade routes. Evidence shows that these revolts are being provoked by Hashemite agents."
ott.175.a:0 "Such pointless waste..."

ott.176.t:0 "Egyptian Arms Discovered In Basra"
ott.176.d:0 "Thanks to an anonymous tip, two shipping containers full of rifles were discovered in Port Basra. Originating from an Egyptian port, these containers had been brought in by a Spanish freighter. It appears that these weapons were destined for rebel groups in southern Iraq, to be used against our soldiers."
ott.176.a:0 "We will get to the bottom of this..."

ott.177.t:0 "Arabian Spies Caught In Damascus"
ott.177.d:0 "Our gendarmerie, working together with local law enforcement, has managed to arrest several Arabian spies in Damascus. Detailed maps of the region and intelligence notes on Ottoman military strength were found in the possession of these agents. Their mission seems to be the formation of clandestine cells across Syria, which would be activated in case of war between Arab states and the Ottoman Empire."
ott.177.a:0 "Such scheming will not go unpunished..."

ott.178.t:0 "Victory Day!"
ott.178.d:0 "Our magnificent Sultan has declared today a day of celebration, in recognition of our glorious victory over the rebellious Arab states."
ott.178.a:0 "May our army be ever-triumphant!"

ott.179.t:0 "The Treaty of Baghdad"
ott.179.d:0 "We've been beaten by the armed forces of Persia. How did this happen? They've captured all our territory east of Euphrates and even occupied parts of Anatolia! We should offer peace to them while we can!"
ott.179.a:0 "Offer a peace treaty, recognising Persian territorial gains."
ott.179.b:0 "No, the war will continue until we march through Tehran!"

ott.180.t:0 "The Treaty of Baghdad"
ott.180.d:0 "We've successfully beaten the armed forces of the Ottoman Empire and conquered large parts of their empire. Now the humiliated Ottoman leadership offers us peace in which they promise to recognise our territorial gains and withdraw from the disputed territory. How shall we react?"
ott.180.a:0 "Accept the proposal, this is more than we hoped!"
ott.180.b:0 "No, the war will continue until our army marches through Kostantiniyye!"

ott.181.t:0 "The Treaty of Baghdad"
ott.181.d:0 "According to the Treaty of Baghdad we must withdraw our force from the remaining parts of our ceded provinces..."
ott.181.a:0 "How humiliating!"

ott.182.t:0 "Persia refused to sign the treaty!"
ott.182.d:0 "Persia refused our generous peace offer and renewed military actions..."
ott.182.a:0 "They will pay for this..."

ott.183.t:0 "New Territories"
ott.183.d:0 "The Arab bloc was successful in its conflict with the Ottoman Empire, but the Ottomans surrendered to the Persian Empire. The Persians annexed all land east of Euphrates to their Empire. We are also victorious, but all we got was this empty desert!"
ott.183.a:0 "The Persians will pay for their insolence..."

ottaxis.102.b:0 "We're content with our piece"

ottaxis.103.t:0 "Iran demands Iraq"
ottaxis.103.d:0 "Outraged by our annexation of Baghdad and Basra, Iran has demanded us to transfer these territories at once or face the consequences. The only way we can defend ourselves in this situation is by asking Egyptian support although the Hejaz debacle has caused serious tears in our relation."
ottaxis.103.a:0 "Call for Egyptian backing"
ottaxis.103.b:0 "We shouldn't anger Iran"

ottaxis.104.t:0 "Trouble in Baghdad"
ottaxis.104.d:0 "The Iraqi lands have always been a hotly contested region of the Middle East and this has once again become apparent now that hostilities between Iran and our Arabian allies are rising up over the city of Baghdad. Both nations have expressed their claims on the region and are not willing to back down. To resolve the crisis and prevent escalation, Arabia has called us in as a mediator in an attempt to force Iran to back down. Our people however have no interest in going to war again so the government has come up with a possible solution to the problem. In exchange for Iran abandonning their claims on Iraq, they will be granted full control over the neutral Kurdistan buffer zone. Others however fear that granting Iran more land will only lead to further trouble in the years to come and would prefer a strong approach against Iranian expansionism."
ottaxis.104.a:0 "Come and get it"
ottaxis.104.b:0 "Propose the Kurdish Solution"
ottaxis.104.c:0 "Arabia is of no use to us any longer"

ottaxis.105.t:0 "Egypt backs Arabia"
ottaxis.105.d:0 "In a fruitless attempt to stop our powerful nation from seizing our rightful lands in Iraq, the Egyptians have decided to stand behind Arabia and are pressuring us to stand down. Backing down now however may lead to great disgruntlement within our own ranks and should not be considered lightly."
ottaxis.105.a:0 "Back Down"
ottaxis.105.b:0 "Tonight we dine in Baghdad!"

ottaxis.106.t:0 "Egypt attempts negotiations"
ottaxis.106.d:0 "Supporting their Arabian allies in their claim on Iraq, Egypt has offered us the Kurdish lands instead. While they are not as rich as Iraq, it does offer us a way out without having to result to war."
ottaxis.106.a:0 "We accept their deal"
ottaxis.106.b:0 "We won't accept anything but Iraq"

ottaxis.107.t:0 "Iran refuses our solution"
ottaxis.107.d:0 "Claiming that all of Iraq is part of Iran, they have refused our offer outright and declared us lunatics for even proposing it. They further repeated that if we do not transfer the lands immediately, they will declare war."
ottaxis.107.a:0 "We stand by Arabia"
ottaxis.107.b:0 "At least we tried..."

ottaxis.108.t:0 "Arabia stands alone"
ottaxis.108.d:0 "Weary of further conflict and desinterested in their worthless Arabian allies, Egypt has turned their back on them and given us free reign to invade Iraq and seize their rich lands."
ottaxis.108.a:0 "Attack at once"

ottaxis.110.t:0 "Treaty of Cairo : Egypt takes Hejaz"
ottaxis.110.d:0 "Egypt, a nation we are allies with in the Cairo Pact, has taken the land of Hejaz. This is rightful Arab land that the Egyptians promised us. Egypt evidently do not respect us nor the Cairo Pact itself at all."
ottaxis.110.a:0 "We cannot survive alone. We can have Iraq at least."
ottaxis.110.b:0 "We can't stand for this insolence. Take Iraq and leave the Pact."

ottaxis.120.t:0 "Egypt proposes and Anti-Arabian Pact"
ottaxis.120.d:0 "Egypt have come to us proposing a pact against Arabia, and have agreed to let us have our claims in Iraq and Bahrain if we join."
ottaxis.120.a:0 "Join their Pact."
ottaxis.120.b:0 "We will not trust the Egyptians."

ottaxis.121.t:0 "Iran refuses an alliance"
ottaxis.121.d:0 "Iran have responded to our offer, and have refused to join our Anti-Arabian alliance, claiming that we would be an untrustworthy ally."
ottaxis.121.a:0 "Egypt stands alone."

ottaxis.140.t:0 "Treaty of Cairo : Greek demands"
ottaxis.140.d:0 "The Cairo Pact stands victorious, and after hundreds of years of suffering and oppression, the Greek people in Turkish lands are finally free!"
ottaxis.140.a:0 "Take our Turkish claims."

ottaxis.200.t:0 "Treaty of Tehran"
ottaxis.200.d:0 "After much fighting, the Ottoman Empire has been defeated. We have captured many of their cities, and liberated thousands from the iron fist of Ottoman rule. Now that we, along with the Cairo Pact, have conquered the sick man, we have the choice of what to do with the spoils. We could take what we claimed, and leave the rest for the Cairo Pact to divide amongst themselves. However, we are not allies with the Cairo Pact. We have the opportunity to also establish a puppet regime in Syria, as a buffer state between us and the Egyptians should they ever go to war with us. That might not go down too well with the Cairo Pact thought..."
ottaxis.200.a:0 "Take our claims, and leave the rest to the Cairo Pact."
ottaxis.200.b:0 "Take all of our claims and establish a puppet regime in Syria to cut off Egypt."

ottaxis.201.t:0 "Treaty of Tehran : Egyptian demands"
ottaxis.201.d:0 "Now that the Ottoman Empire has been defeated, thanks to a united effort from our allies in the Cairo Pact and with great help from Iran, we must now split the spoils between us. Iran, having done much against the Ottomans, took their claims first, keeping it to what they promised to take. Now, we have a choice. We can either take the states that we originally claimed, leaving the rest for our allies. Or, we can take Hejaz as well, and leave the rest. This won't go down too well with our allies though..."
ottaxis.201.a:0 "Take the Levant, and leave the rest to our allies."
ottaxis.201.b:0 "Take the Levant, Hejaz and leave the rest."

ottaxis.202.t:0 "Treaty of Tehran : Arabian demands"
ottaxis.202.d:0 "Now, with the Ottoman Empire defeated, we can make our demands. Although we cannot unite the Arab people under one flag, Egypt has left us the land of Hejaz, and that is better than nothing."
ottaxis.202.a:0 "The Ottomans fall as we begin to rise."

ottaxis.203.t:0 "Abandoned by our allies"
ottaxis.203.d:0 "Betrayal! Egypt and Iran have taken more than they promised, and have left us no land to take. Thousands of Arab soldiers died fighting for a more united Arabia, and yet we get nothing from it. The Cairo Pact alliance evidently meant nothing to the Egyptians, and Iran is filling the void the Ottomans left."
ottaxis.203.a:0 "If Egypt is willing to betray its allies, there is no point in the Pact."

ottaxis.204.t:0 "Iran takes Syria"
ottaxis.204.d:0 "Iran have taken far more land than they promised, setting up a puppet regime in Syria when they said they'd leave that land for us! This is a great betrayal, leaving us far less land from the war, and leaving the Arabs nothing. They will also most likely blame us for this, and might leave the Cairo Pact."
ottaxis.204.a:0 "Take our claims in Hejaz, the Arabs won't be happy..."
